- **`Capture Viewport`** - activate the extension (either using the toolbar button or the [keyboard shortcut](#keyboard-shortcut)) to capture the visible part of the screen. You will be either prompted to save the screenshot or the screenshot will be saved automatically (depending on your [download preferences](#save-location))

When you release the mouse button the selected area will be cropped and you will be either prompted to save the screenshot or the screenshot will be saved automatically (depending on your [download preferences](#save-location))

- **`Crop and Wait`** - activate the extension (either using the toolbar button or the [keyboard shortcut](#keyboard-shortcut)) then hold down your left mouse button somewhere on the page and drag your mouse in any direction. When you are ready - activate the extension again (either through the toolbar button or the keyboard shortcut) to crop the selected area. You will be either prompted to save the screenshot or the screenshot will be saved automatically (depending on your [download preferences](#save-location))


# Image Format

- **`PNG`** - better image quality but larger file size. Best suited for cropping and capturing simple web pages
- **`JPG`** - smaller file size but a bit worse image quality. Useful when taking fullscreen screenshots of images and videos


# Save Format

- **`To File`** - you will be either prompted to save the screenshot or the screenshot will be saved automatically (depending on your [download preferences](#save-location))
- **`To Clipboard (Base64)`** - the screenshot will be copied to the clipboard as Base64 encoded string


# Screenshot Size

- **`Preserver original DPI size`** - the screenshot will be saved with the actual page size that you are seeing on screen
- **`Adjust to actual size`** - on HDPI displays like Retina or zoomed in pages, the screenshot will be downscaled to the original page size
